## Recommendations :gift:

<!-- * If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)
-->

I would highly advise them to raise the daily transaction limits for non-KYC users.

<!-- * Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?-->

Because, it shows users an assurance that they are committed to preserve crypto’s intended purpose along with privacy and anonymity which sustains the business operations in the long run. Also, this way company can attract more small to medium size investors and thereby people will begin to trust them more and it will also increase the transaction volume even higher. 

<!--
* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?
* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?
-->

Same existing infrastructure can leverage but server capacity needs to be increased in order to handle the volume. Plus, company has to invest more funds in R&D to secure the user’s data and systems to keep them safe from intruders
